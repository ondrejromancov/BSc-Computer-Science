<h2>Early life</h2>

<p>
	During his study of civil engineering in the Technical College of Berlin Charlottenburg (Technischen Hochschule) Konrad Zuse focused on studying of the construction of buildings and roads. This type of construction required huge systems if linear equations to be solved which was at that time very time consuming by means of logarithmic rule or even mechanical calculator from that time.
</p>

<p>
	Shortly after his graduation in 1935, Zuse started working on the construction of a computer. He firstly worked on it in his free time, but soon decide to devote himself to the construction entirely. He was financially supported by his family and his fellow students helped him with the actual construction. Originally his computers were named V1 to V4, but Zuse later renamed them to avoid their association with Nazi developed rockets V1 to V4.

<h2>First computers</h2>

<p>
	Zuse’s first computer Z1 was not reliable due to the insufficient mechanical precision. However during the WWII, Zuse was supported by government finances and developed first reliable model called Z2 and the first reliable programmable computer Z3. Even though his Z2 and Z3 were great achievements, they were constructed manually and took relatively large amount of time to construct. That is why Zuse has very soon started working on the development of Z4 which was intended for large scale manufacturing. In 1948 Zuse, presented Z4 in EHT in Zurich where it was put in action and proved to be reliable. At the time Z4 supported powerful arithmetic exception handling and overall performance of 1000 operations per hour.

<h2>Zuse KG computers</h2>

<p>
	Zuse’s company Zuse KG continued to manufacture relays computers —Z5 (1952), Z7 and Z11 (1954), drawing computer Graphomat Z64 (1957). In 1957 Zuse decided to replace the relays technology with electronics. The Z22 was ready in 1958 and was an electronic computer (based on vacuum tubes), it was also the first "stored-program" computer of Zuse. In 1961 the Zuse KG launched the Z23, which was a transistor computer with almost identical logic as the Z22. The next computer of Zuse was Z31, which had a decimal arithmetic unit, and it was specifically designed for banking and commercial purposes. In 1964 was launched the Z25 computer, which was a small and cheap machine that would be suitable for various different applications. The last computer of Zuse was Z43 (1964), a modern transistor computer with TTL logic
