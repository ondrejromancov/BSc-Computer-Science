# Coursework 1 

## Question 1
A command line application which stores and retrieves student details. 

## Question 2 
A command line game with Magic Squares.

### How to play
1. Launch the game with: `java QuestionTwo`
2. Enter an odd integer *n* to create n*n Magic Square of integers
3. The square will be shuffled and the aim of the game is to reconstruct it such that the sum of each row, column and diagonal is equal to n(n^2 + 1)/2
4. To reconstruct the square, make moves in the following form: `i j direction` where *i* and *j* specify the row and column of the element to be swapped and the *direction* (*U*, *D*, *L* or *R*) represents the direction it should be swapped with.

## Question 3
Design and implementation of several animal classes that maximise the concept of inheritance and polymorphism.
