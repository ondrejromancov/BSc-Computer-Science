<h2>Why are Zuse's inventions still relevant today?</h2>

<p>
	Konrad Zuse is considered to be the inventor of the modern computer. Without him, computers would only be able to calculate one operation only. There would have to be separate computers for different operations that would all have to work together to calculate more complex mathematical or logical equations. Zuse’s invention allows us to use one computer for different operations which drastically reduces financial costs of buying a computer and greatly increases the ability of the computer itself.
</p>

<p>
	Also the fact that Zuse wrote world’s first high level computer language which allowed anyone to write custom programs for their needs. This was a paradigm shift as suddenly computers could be finally be personal and be used for enormous number of different tasks which could all be customised. This was the beginning of the new era of software development and engineering which is nowadays a very prosperous and large business that influences our every day lives.
