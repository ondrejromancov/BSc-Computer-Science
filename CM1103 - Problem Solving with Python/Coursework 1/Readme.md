## Problem Specifications
A small, local branch of a bank employs a single teller. The manager is considering ways to improve cus- tomer satisfaction by reducing queuing times. This coursework will use computer simulation to provide the necessary evidence to support their decision.

## Implementation
This coursework investigates whether it would be better for the bank to invest in new equipment that would serve individual customers faster or by hiring a second teller and divide the queue into two queues.
